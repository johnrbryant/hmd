In addition, a cover letter needs to be written with the
following:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item A 100 word or less summary indicating on scientific grounds
why the paper should be considered for a wide-ranging journal like
\textsl{Nature} instead of a more narrowly focussed journal.
 \item A 100 word or less summary aimed at a non-scientific audience,
written at the level of a national newspaper.  It may be used for
\textsl{Nature}'s press release or other general publicity.
 \item The cover letter should state clearly what is included as the
submission, including number of figures, supporting manuscripts
and any Supplementary Information (specifying number of items and
format).
 \item The cover letter should also state the number of
words of text in the paper; the number of figures and parts of
figures (for example, 4 figures, comprising 16 separate panels in
total); a rough estimate of the desired final size of figures in
terms of number of pages; and a full current postal address,
telephone and fax numbers, and current e-mail address.
